# Remote Login App â€” Design Notes

## Overview

This proof of concept demonstrates a secure, disposable remote desktop session that allows a user to log in to a third-party web service without exposing their credentials to the backend. After login, the system extracts, encrypts, and stores the authentication cookies, then destroys the session VM and its subdomain.

## Key Architecture Components

**Frontend**  
- Lets the user create a new session via a simple UI.  
- Connects to an isolated VM desktop using noVNC over HTTPS.
- Lets the user extract past and current session cookies.  

**Backend API (FastAPI)**  
- `POST /session`: Creates an ephemeral VM, sets up a Cloudflare subdomain, and configures HTTPS routing. 
- `DELETE /session/{session_id}`: Tears down the VM and its DNS record. 
- `GET /extract_cookies`: Uses Chrome DevTools to extract cookies securely, encrypts them, and saves to MongoDB Atlas.  
- `GET /cookies`: Lets the user fetch their encrypted cookies with a session ID and token.  

**VM Environment**  
- Oracle Cloud VM launched with a custom script.  
- Runs Xvfb + LXDE, Google Chrome with remote debugging, noVNC, and Caddy as a reverse proxy. 
- Python script runs a FastAPI server which extracts cookies and returns them to the backend when invoked by it.

**Infrastructure Automation**  
- Cloudflare handles DNS, HTTPS, and proxying.  
- DNS records and VMs are ephemeral and destroyed on session end.  
- Background process enforce auto termination after 15 minutes.

## Security Measures

- **No credential capture**: All credentials stay inside the VM; only cookies are extracted.
- **Encryption at rest**: Cookies are encrypted using Fernet keys, stored separately from DB config.
- **End-to-end TLS**: Cloudflare proxy ensures all traffic uses valid HTTPS.
- **Ephemeral sessions**: Nothing persists after VM teardown.
- **Access controls**: CORS and ingress rules (On Oracle cloud) limits who can hit the API.
- **Rate limiting**: Protects against abuse of VM creation.

## Observability

- Logs for session lifecycle, DNS actions, VM events, and cookie extraction.
- Validation script logs key steps.
- Cloud dashboard confirms ephemeral resources.
- Could expand with metrics for active sessions and usage.

## Design Trade-offs

| Aspect           | Decision                  | Trade-off                                      |
|------------------|---------------------------|-----------------------------------------------|
| VM vs. Container | VM for simpler PoC        | Containers are faster to start and stop, but add networking complexity (overlay, orchestration).    |
| Cloud Provider   |Oracle cloud infrastructure| Free or lower-cost credits for PoC. AWS or GCP might have more automation tools but higher cost.       |
| Database         | MongoDB Atlas             | Easy JSON storage for unstructured cookie data; a SQL DB could add stricter schema and ACID guarantees but more overhead.         |
| Remote Access    | noVNC over HTTPS          | Easier than setting up WebRTC or SSH tunneling, slightly higher latency than native solutions.         |
| Cookie Extraction| Chrome DevTools           | Simple, reliable and easier than hard-coding open tabs in script. Headless scraping tools or proxies could offer more stealth but add complexity.   |
| Dynamic DNS      | Cloudflare subdomains     | Rapid SSL + DNS management, custom certs with static IPs could remove propagation delays but are harder to automate.             |
| Auto Termination | Handled by backend background processes  | Could use instance metadata or serverless for reliability |

## Alternate Approaches

- **Containers for faster boot and teardown**
- **WebRTC instead of VNC** for better UX
- **Secrets Manager for keys** instead of local config

## Summary

Disposable VMs, ephemeral DNS, and strong encryption ensure we can capture and store session cookies securely without ever handling user credentials.
